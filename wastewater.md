## Background 

Surveillance of pathogens spreading through a population is an essential tool in epidemic response and public health resource planning. Historically programes have used reported cases, hospitalisations and various sentinel systems to track infection prevalence and transmission in the population. For many infections, virus is shed in feces. In recent years protocols have been developed to quantify the concentration of viral RNA within sewage for a growing number of pathogens. By monitoring municipal wastewater systems it is possible to track fluctuations in prevalence of disease in the population served by the system. 

## Context 

We are part of a collaboration in Switzerland that monitors waste water at treatment plants across Switzerland. Samples are collected between 5 and 7 days a week, viral concentrations of SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A and B and RSV are quantified using digital deoplet PCR and amplicons are sequenced using illumina next generation sequncing.
