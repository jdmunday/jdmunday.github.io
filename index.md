# Interests 
Epidemics have a profound impact on health and society, control measures can also severely disrupt daily life. Improving epidemic response requires better understanding of transmission and dynamics in various populations. In my research I principally focus on how spatial and social factors contribute to infectious disease dynamics and how these factors should be considered when responding to outbreaks. My current research activities include using mathematical and statistical models to improve situational awareness during epidemics through real-time analysis and understanding how infections spread between school-aged children in different contexts.
